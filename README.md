# Rogue Like Calculator
##### Unfinished project

Project with the idea of a rogue-like calculator game, which has all the basic operations (**sum, subtraction, division, multiplication**). In the future, it will have a modulus operator, square root, log, etc.  
At the start of the game, your calculator will have the basics, and as you progress through the game, you'll receive coins, which you can use to buy new operations.

## The Calculator
It has limited spaces for operations; in total, there will be four **slots**.  
The idea is to propose a new level of difficulty, where the player will make choices between the available operations.

Example of a calculator:

## Levels

How the levels work is quite simple: the player will receive a target number, which must be reached using the available operations.  
By the end of the level, they will receive a certain amount of coins, which is defined by their proficiency in reaching the required number.

## Shop
In the shop, the player can buy new operations that may help throughout their journey. The shop can serve as an interlude scene, where inventory management can happen and operations can be switched.
